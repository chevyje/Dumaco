This is a school project done at the Hogeschool Utrecht in the netherlands. it is a problem from a metal company called Dumaco located in Oss in the netherlands.

The problem is that their is a paper system that they want to moderize.
We are working on this in our 2nd semester of our first year with a team of 5 students.
